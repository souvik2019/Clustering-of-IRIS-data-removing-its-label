# Clustering-of-IRIS-data-removing-its-label

Iris data has three label (type of flower), namely setosa, verginica, versicolor.

Firstly these labels are removed and then try to make an artificial clusters of flowers.

Objective is to make clusters such that within cluster sum of square can be minimized.

Regarding original labels there are some mismatches but we achieved lower within sum of square than original data.
